# CSV-Converter
Take a .CSV file and convert it into a .xlsx file.

It's very easy to use, the program take a file named 'input.CSV' and return an output file named 'output.xlsx'.
The input file must be in the same directory of the program.

For the application I used Python 3.7.3 and for the moment I can guarantee that it will work on Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10 and
Windows Server 2000, 2003, 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2019.

Actually the .xlsx file generated from the program, should be compatible with all the version of Microsoft Excel but I can't guarantee this.

If you have any issue please tell me and I will try to solve the problem.
